# Develop(ry) Bootstrap 4 Shortcodes

** WORK IN PROGRESS**

This plugin is not yet ready for use in production. I'm currently working on a base set of shortcodes that will be used in our Develop(ry) Lite theme. The plan then for the plugin is to be extended and have as ready-to-use components that will speed up the creation of custom pages and add customized content to posts.

I will update this note when I'm ready to release a production-ready version of this plugin, which will be submitted to the WordPress theme repository and can be used for free.

## About

A set of WordPress shortcodes for Bootstrap 4 that are supposed to ease the post/page creation in our Develop(ry) themes. 

It will be compatible and used by any other WordPress theme.
