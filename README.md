# Develop(ry) Bootstrap 4 Shortcodes

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

**This plugin is not yet ready for use in production.** I'm currently working on a base set of shortcodes that will be used in our Develop(ry) Lite theme. The plan then for the plugin is to be extended and have all Bootstrap 4 shortcodes added and additionally have ready-to-use components that will speed up the content creation for custom Posts & Pages.

**I will update this note when I'm ready to release a production-ready version of this plugin, which will be submitted to the WordPress theme repository and can be used for free.**

Currently there are shortcodes avaialble for alerts, badges, blockquotes, buttons, jumbotron, tables & basic typography.

## About

A WordPress plugin with set of shortcodes for Bootstrap 4 that are supposed to speed up the Post/Page creation in our Develop(ry) themes. Additionaly ready-to-use components would be added and can saved (exported) for use to any other WordPress theme.

**The plugin will be compatible and used by any other WordPress theme.**
